## Installation
To run Code Writer, you need to install Streamlit and set up the Google Generative AI API:

    pip install streamlit

    pip install google.generativeai

Set up your API key as per Google's Generative AI documentation and include it in the application (api.py file).

## Usage Example
    import streamlit as st
    import google.generativeai as genai
    from api import api

    # Configure the API key
    genai.configure(api_key=api)

    # Set default parameters
    defaults = {
        'model': 'models/text-bison-001',
        'temperature': 0.25,
        'candidate_count': 1,
        'top_k': 40,
        'top_p': 0.95,
    }

    st.title('Code Writer')
    st.write('You can ask me to code anything')
    final_response = None

    # Creating a side panel for inputs
    with st.sidebar:
        st.write("## Code Generator Settings")
        programming_language = st.selectbox("Choose the programming language:", 
                                        ["Python", "Go", "JavaScript", "TypeScript"])
        prompt = st.text_input("What do you want to code?")
        if st.button('Generate'):
            formatted_prompt = f"Write a {programming_language.lower()} code about {prompt}"
            response = genai.generate_text(
                **defaults,
                prompt=formatted_prompt
            )
            final_response = response
    if final_response != None:
        st.write(final_response.result)
